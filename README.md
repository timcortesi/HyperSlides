# HyperSlides

HyperSlides is a simple web application development tool which is a cross between HyperCard and Google Slides.

HyperSlides is inteded for use by children who have experience building slideshows in tools like PowerPoint and Google Slides, but want to add more interactivity and non-linear elements to their slide decks. HyperSlides implements basic slideshow functionality (drag and drop elements), but also also allows for direct DOM interactions via JavaScript from a simple interface.
